# FamilyDB

An SQL project implemented using scripts in MySQL. It represents a usual Bangladeshi family and some data concerning the family members.

The file "create+insert.sql" can be used to create a database named "family", to drop existing tables in the database, to create new tables and insert data into them.

The "queries.sql" file contains some queries to be performed on the "family" database.

The SQL scripts can easily be used from inside the MySQL command line through the command
``` sql
SOURCE <filename with extension>;
```
